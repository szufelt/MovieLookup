# MovieLookup
A homework assignment that is a web app that is a simple database for movies.

In this homework assignment, I used ASP.NET and C# in Visual Studio to create a web app for a small movie database. This web app requires registering as a new
user, and logging in with a username and password. From there, one can search a small database (10 movies). The displayed list can then be clicked on to show a
detailed description of the movie, along with a link to view the trailer on Youtube. A user can also save movies from the database into a dedicated watchlist,
all while being able to navigate to the other pages at any time.
